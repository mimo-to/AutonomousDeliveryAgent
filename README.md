# AutonomousDeliveryAgent
An autonomous delivery agent that navigates a 2D grid city with static and dynamic obstacles. Implements BFS, Uniform-Cost, A*, and local search replanning to optimize delivery efficiency (time, fuel). Includes multiple test maps, experimental results, and dynamic obstacle handling with proof-of-concept demo.
